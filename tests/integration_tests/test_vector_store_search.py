"""Integration tests for CouchbaseVectorStore search functionality.

This test suite verifies the integration between Langchain, Couchbase, and OpenAI
by testing various vector search scenarios including:
- Normal vector similarity search
- Error handling for null fields in search results
- Custom search options with field filtering

Requirements:
- Running Couchbase server with vector search capability
- OpenAI API key configured in environment
- Proper vector search index configuration
